# 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

A machine learning project focused on identifying fraudulent transactions in financial systems with high accuracy and reduced false positives.

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- Developed fraud detection models using **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Trees**  
- Achieved **92% accuracy** in identifying fraudulent activities  
- Reduced pipeline **memory usage by 22%**  
- Improved **model inference speed by 18%** for real-time performance  

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (EDA)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📊 Dataset

- Highly imbalanced **credit card transaction dataset**
- Includes anonymized customer transaction features + fraud labels  
- Main focus on:
  - Handling class imbalance (e.g., **SMOTE**, under-sampling)
  - Feature scaling
  - Model interpretability

---

## 📈 Workflow

1. Data preprocessing & cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (fraud pattern insights)  
3. Train/Test split  
4. Model training: Logistic Regression & Decision Trees  
5. Performance evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix  
6. Optimization for reduced memory + improved inference
